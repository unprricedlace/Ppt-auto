Key Enhancements:
1. Smart Allocation Algorithm

Composite Scoring: Instead of just picking the cheapest option, it uses a weighted score considering both efficiency (percentage savings) and absolute savings
Configurable Weights: You can adjust the balance between efficiency and absolute savings
Constraint-Based Selection: Respects business constraints rather than blindly choosing the lowest cost

2. Business Constraints

Location Capacity Limits: Set maximum positions per location to prevent unrealistic concentrations
Role Change Controls: Option to allow/disallow designation changes
Senior Role Protection: Prevents demoting senior executives (VP, ED, MD)
Minimum Savings Threshold: Only considers moves that achieve a minimum percentage saving

3. Detailed Position Tracking

Individual Position IDs: Tracks each position separately for precise allocation
Move Summary: Shows exactly how many positions are moving to each destination
Before/After Comparison: Clear visualization of position distribution changes

4. Enhanced Analytics

Efficiency Analysis: Shows savings percentage for each move
Location Flow Diagrams: Visualizes how positions move between locations
Cost Efficiency Scatter Plot: Helps identify the most efficient relocations
Summary Tables: Groups relocations by destination with totals

5. Realistic Business Logic

Prevents Over-Concentration: Location limits ensure realistic distribution
Balanced Approach: Considers both cost savings and operational efficiency
Constraint Validation: Each move is validated against business rules
Multiple Optimization Goals: Balances cost, efficiency, and business constraints

How to Use:

Set Constraints: Configure location limits and business rules in the sidebar
Add Employees: Select current employee distributions
Tune Algorithm: Adjust efficiency vs. savings weights based on your priorities
Run Optimization: The tool will find the best allocation considering all constraints
Review Results: Analyze the detailed relocation plan and visualizations

This approach gives you much more realistic and business-appropriate recommendations rather than just suggesting "move everyone to India" which the original greedy algorithm would do.RetryAAwhat other algorithms can be used to better the use case can we discussEditGreat question! Let's explore various algorithms that could significantly improve this employee cost optimization use case. Each has different strengths depending on your specific business needs.
1. Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
Best for: Guaranteed optimal solutions with complex constraints
python# Conceptual approach
from pulp import *

def ilp_optimization(positions, target_savings, constraints):
    # Decision variables: x[i,j,k] = 1 if position i moves to designation j, location k
    prob = LpProblem("Employee_Optimization", LpMinimize)
    
    # Variables
    moves = LpVariable.dicts("move", 
                           [(i,j,k) for i in positions 
                            for j in designations for k in locations], 
                           cat='Binary')
    
    # Objective: Minimize cost while achieving target savings
    prob += lpSum([cost[j][k] * moves[i,j,k] for i,j,k in moves])
    
    # Constraints
    # Each position assigned to exactly one role/location
    # Location capacity limits
    # Minimum savings requirements
    # Role change restrictions
Pros: Mathematically optimal, handles complex constraints
Cons: Can be slow for large datasets, requires specialized libraries
2. Genetic Algorithm (GA)
Best for: Large datasets with many variables and non-linear objectives
pythondef genetic_algorithm_optimization():
    # Individual = assignment of all positions to new roles/locations
    # Fitness = cost savings + constraint violations penalty
    # Crossover = swap assignments between solutions
    # Mutation = randomly change some assignments
    
    population = initialize_random_population()
    for generation in range(max_generations):
        fitness_scores = evaluate_population(population)
        parents = select_parents(population, fitness_scores)
        offspring = crossover_and_mutate(parents)
        population = select_survivors(parents + offspring)
Pros: Handles complex objectives, finds diverse solutions
Cons: No guarantee of optimality, requires parameter tuning
3. Simulated Annealing
Best for: Avoiding local optima in cost optimization
pythondef simulated_annealing():
    current_solution = generate_initial_solution()
    temperature = initial_temp
    
    while temperature > min_temp:
        neighbor = generate_neighbor(current_solution)
        delta = cost(neighbor) - cost(current_solution)
        
        if delta < 0 or random() < exp(-delta/temperature):
            current_solution = neighbor
        
        temperature *= cooling_rate
Pros: Good at escaping local optima, relatively simple
Cons: Requires temperature schedule tuning
4. Multi-Objective Optimization (NSGA-II)
Best for: Balancing multiple competing objectives
python# Objectives could include:
objectives = [
    minimize_total_cost,
    minimize_relocations,
    maximize_geographic_distribution,
    minimize_role_changes,
    maximize_employee_satisfaction
]
Pros: Provides Pareto-optimal solutions, handles trade-offs well
Cons: More complex to implement and interpret
5. Constraint Programming (CP)
Best for: Complex business rules and logical constraints
pythonfrom ortools.sat.python import cp_model

def constraint_programming():
    model = cp_model.CpModel()
    
    # Variables for each position assignment
    assignments = {}
    for pos in positions:
        for role in roles:
            for loc in locations:
                assignments[pos, role, loc] = model.NewBoolVar(f'assign_{pos}_{role}_{loc}')
    
    # Complex business constraints
    # IF senior role in US THEN cannot move to junior role
    # IF critical project THEN limit relocations
    # Team cohesion constraints
6. Machine Learning-Based Approaches
Reinforcement Learning
python# Agent learns optimal relocation policies
class RelocationAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.q_table = {}  # State-action values
    
    def choose_action(self, state):
        # State = current employee distribution + constraints
        # Action = specific relocation move
        # Reward = cost savings - disruption penalty
Clustering + Optimization
python# Use clustering to group similar positions, then optimize within clusters
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

def cluster_based_optimization():
    # Cluster positions by role, cost, location preferences
    clusters = KMeans(n_clusters=k).fit(position_features)
    
    # Optimize within each cluster
    for cluster in clusters:
        optimize_cluster(cluster)
7. Hybrid Approaches
Two-Stage Optimization
pythondef two_stage_approach():
    # Stage 1: Strategic allocation (which locations to use)
    strategic_plan = solve_location_selection()
    
    # Stage 2: Tactical assignment (which specific positions)
    tactical_plan = assign_positions_to_locations(strategic_plan)
Heuristic + Exact Methods
pythondef hybrid_optimization():
    # Use heuristic for initial solution
    initial_solution = greedy_with_constraints()
    
    # Refine with exact method on smaller subproblems
    final_solution = local_search_improvement(initial_solution)
8. Advanced Heuristics
Tabu Search
pythondef tabu_search():
    current = initial_solution()
    tabu_list = []
    
    while not termination_condition():
        neighbors = generate_neighbors(current)
        best_neighbor = select_best_non_tabu(neighbors, tabu_list)
        current = best_neighbor
        update_tabu_list(tabu_list, best_neighbor)
Ant Colony Optimization
pythondef ant_colony_optimization():
    # Ants construct solutions by following pheromone trails
    # Good moves get stronger pheromones
    # Naturally balances exploration vs exploitation
